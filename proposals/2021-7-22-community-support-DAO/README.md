# Community Support DAO Governance Proposal

## Proposal: Allocate 60,000 OSMO from the community pool to a community multisig address to be spent on bootstrapping and managing the Osmosis community support DAO

The DAO will be controlled by a 3-of-5 community multisig. The admins of this multisig will be: 
* Michael Barbera (TG @MikeBarb)
* Dennis Kim (TG @SJ_DK)
* Edwin Hartman (TG @DynamicManic)
* Justin M (TG @jm124578)
* Ernest Serwenmøøn (TG @ernestsm)

Every three months, the DAO will produce a transparency report detailing the use of funds in the previous quarter. The report is expected to state the amount of funds spent in the quarter, and for what purpose they were used. See sample-transparency-report.png included in this gist as an example of what is expected.

Initially, the DAO will assemble a team to manage channels specifically for Osmosis support issues. This team will be responsible for creating and maintaining a Telegram channel specifically for any technical problems or questions that Osmosis users might be having. The DAO will also provide support to Twitter users experiencing difficulty with Osmosis. Furthermore, the DAO will use funds for training new support staff members.

Over time, the DAO will spearhead more community-run initiatives and provide an organized process through which community pool funds can be allocated and dispersed. The DAO will eventually become informal community leadership regarding protocol governance. DAO members can help other community leaders formulate ideas for how to improve Osmosis and collaboratively draft and submit these proposals. In particular, the DAO will assume a leadership role in facilitating regular discussions about updating pool rewards and submitting proposals to this end. 

This team will help increase decentralization in Osmosis by putting the community in charge of key operations and distributing OSMO back to community members who help onboard more users through technical support and general education. The DAO will set a precedent not just for Osmosis but the overall DeFi industry. This proposal is the first of its kind among DeFi protocols.

In coming years, the DAO will require additional funds to continue operating. The Osmosis community can allocate new funds to the DAO through future governance proposals.
